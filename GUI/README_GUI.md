First codes from Thomas:
"We made a thing that interactively updates a figure based on prior measurement data (interactive_plotting.py). 
The next step would be to make it more interactive and let users click (work in progress: the 
interactive_plotting_mouseclick.py file). The other files are toy examples I found when I googled some keywords."
The data for the interactive plotting routine is in "Prober2Chip42_19-11-02_60Hopfield.ipynb"
